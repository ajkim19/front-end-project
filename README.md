Picking Pals is an app that helps potential dog owners view details about a certain breed. The application grabs data by making API calls to theDogAPI, which provides both the textual information as well as the photographs.

HTML, CSS, and TypeScript were utilized in the creation of this application.

## Features

- **Concise Information**: Most of the descriptions provided are factual, with little room for interpretation.
- **Create a Favorites List**: When browsing through the list of dogs, breeds can be saved to a favorites list for future reference.
- **Rank Your Favorites**: Breeds in the favorites list can be ranked by desirability.
- **Remove a Favorite**: Breeds in the favorites list can also be removed.
